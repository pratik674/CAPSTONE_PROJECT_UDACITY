# CNN for Dog Breed Identification

Using Convolutional Neural Network to identify dog breeds

## Motivation
You may be quite well versed with identification of  different breeds of dog, for example a Retriever or German SHepherd. There are different types of dog in a particular breed based on color, shape, demography, coat type etc. It gets increasingly difficult to spot differences to an untrained eye. An intuitive way is to compare the image to a prior identified image of the same breed. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are particularly well-suited for image identification tasks due to their unique architecture and characteristics.Â 
The architecture of a CNN is in itself  inspired by the visual processing mechanisms of the human brain. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, organized in a hierarchical manner to progressively learn and extract meaningful features from the input data.
The idea is to use CNN to make our lives easier in letting the algorithm decide which breed of dog it is.
